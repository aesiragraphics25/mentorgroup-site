		<h1>Fearfully and Wonderfully Made - Psalm 139:14</h1>
		<p>Our greatest reward will be to present to society, our young women that are fearfully and wonderfully made.
		Our goal is to provide services for young women throughout the community, including workshops, seminars, and educational projects, as well as serving to be role models for others. It is our desire to collaborate and network with other organizations and companies to provide awareness and fulfill our mission.</p>
